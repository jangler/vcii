How to contribute
-----------------

Use the usual "fork & pull" model--just fork the repository, then make a pull
request on the project's GitHub page when you're finished making changes. If
you just want to report a bug or request a feature, use the issue tracker.

Coding guidelines
-----------------

vcii should depend only on Python 3. No external libraries should be required,
not even Python libraries.

Code should pass inspection from pep8 and pylint -E. It should also have full
line and branch test coverage, except for parts of the code which are not
practically testable using the unittest module, e.g. keyboard input.

These metrics represent only minimum standards to which code should comply.
Just because these tools approve code doesn't meen it's good, so use common
sense!
